# Motorcycle Store Landing Page

This project is a **modern** and **minimalist** landing page concept for a motorcycle store, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It is a **static, design-only layout** created to help me improve my front-end design skills.

The focus was on crafting a clean, visually appealing user interface without any interactivity or JavaScript.  
Through this project, I practiced structuring HTML elements effectively and styling them with responsive, modern CSS to ensure the layout looks great across various screen sizes.
